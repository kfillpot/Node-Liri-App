### Commands to run LIRI

Since I've added the Inquirer package, you just need to run 

```node liri.js``` it will prompt you to select a query and then asks you for the value (i.e. song name, movie name)

What each command should do:

  1. node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
    ![Image of concert](images/concert.png)

  2. node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
    ![Image of spotify](images/spotify.png)
  
  3. node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
    ![Image of movie](images/movie.png)
